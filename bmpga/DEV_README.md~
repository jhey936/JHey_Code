Code style:

Try and be consistent with PEP8. (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008)

I have been a little inconsistent with my docstrings, but I am now trying to follow Google's conventions:
https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html?showone=Comments#Comments
New docstrings should all be in this style
If you need to change a docstring please update it to this style
Note: there is a pycharm option to help with this

Try to be consistent with class/method/variable naming.
Classes: CamelCase
Instances: lowercase
Methods/functions: lower_case_with_underscores


I am trying to provide type hints with all public function and method calls where possible, so if you spot an un-hinted
 argument, feel free to correct it. Also try to type hint any new functions etc.



Project interpreter:

I am only testing using python version 3.6.4 but this project should work with any version above 3.5

I suggest using a clean virtual environment to run this project:
requirements.txt as well as Pipfiles for using pipenv should be kept up to date in the top-level directory.



This preamble should be added at the top of any new files:
