# Feel free to add to this list, but do not revise anything already present without putting some kind of explicit

# If you need to update something for your own reasons, look into the documentation for the class

#
# Various Atomic Radii are taken from http://www.crystalmaker.com/support/tutorials/crystalmaker/atomic-radii/index.html
#
# According to the CrystalMaker website which has collated this data:
#
# Atomic Radii: values are calculated from:
#
# E Clementi, D L Raimondi, W P Reinhardt (1963) J Chem Phys. 38:2686.
#
# Ionic Radii: these data are taken from an empirical system of unified atomic-ionic radii, which is
#   suitable for describing anion-cation contacts in ionic structures. The data were derived by the comparison of
#   bond lengths in over 1200 bond types in ionic, metallic, and covalent crystals and molecules by:
#
# J C Slater (1964) J Chem Phys 41:3199
#
# J C Slater (1965) Quantum Theory of Molecules and Solids. Symmetry and Bonds
#   in Crystals. Vol 2. McGraw-Hill, New York.
#
# Note that calculated data have been used for the following elements: He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, At and Rn.
#  These data were taken from:
#
# E Clementi, D L Raimondi, W P Reinhardt (1963) J Chem Phys 38:2686
#
# Covalent Radii: Data given here are taken from WebElements, copyright Mark Winter, University of Sheffield, UK.
#
# Van-der-Waals Radii: Van der Waals radii are established from contact distances between non-bonding atoms in
# touching molecules or atoms. Most data here are from:
#
# A Bondi (1964) J Phys Chem 68:441
#
# "Crystal" Radii: These data are taken from Shannon & Prewitt's (S∓P) seminal work on "physical" ionic radii, as
#   determined from measurements of real structures.
#
# Note that in most cases S∓P quote different radii for the same element: the radii vary according to charge and
#   coordination number. We have chosen the most-common charges (oxidation states) and coordination numbers.
#   The details are given in the element text file after each data entry.

#
# NOTE:
# Non-atomic particles i.e. Lennard-Jones particles and Dummy Atoms are given at the end.
# Numbering for these starts at 200 and descriptive symbols should be used
