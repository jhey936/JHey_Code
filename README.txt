In the Teaching_Notebooks_Examples directory you will find some jupyter-notebooks written in pure python related to two sets of training materials I have created/given for members of the school of chemistry who have had limited exposure to programming.


In the natural_products_project directory you will find some code I have written in pure python as part of a side project I was involved in, using graph analysis in the categorisation of the backbone ring structures and common functional groups of a wide range of pharmaceutically active natural compounds, and some traditional pharmaceuticals.


In the CPP_cryptography_example directory you will find some c++ code written as a side project related to a modern c++ training course I attended.


There is a ~2 year old copy of the Birmingham Molecular Genetic Algorithm (BMPGA) included in the bmpga directory. This is the latest version I am able to share as later versions contain unpublished material which I consider confidential.
This is mostly written in python and has ~90% unittest coverage, and was developed using TDD principles.
